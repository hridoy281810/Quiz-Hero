        <h4>.forEach(), .map(), .filter() , find() ...What's the difference?</h4>
        <p><span class="fw-bold">Answer:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Map(): If you want to get propertynames from an array through map then the property names will be output as an array.</li>
         <li>forEach(): If I don't want to return an array, I use forEach</li>
         <li>filter(): The filter works according to the condition. The data that matches the condition will be output.</li>
         <li>find(): 
            Find and Filter work in very similar terms. But find will only output the first data that matches.</li>

        <h4>what is difference between local storage session storage and cookies?</h4>
        <p><span class="fw-bold">Answer:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Local Storage: The data that is permanently stored in the local store remains after the refresh, and even if the browser is closed and the browser is opened again, the data remains, so it can be said that the data is permanently stored in the local storage.</li>

         <li>Cookie: Cookie data is stored on server side or client side. During a web browsing session, data is stored as data stings.</li>
